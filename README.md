# JD-portfolio
This webpage is vital in showcasing not only my current projects, but also my background as an upcoming web developer. As an individual navigates through the webpage, they'll be able to first-hand see my progress as a developer.

When the user first logs into the webpage, they will be presented with home viewport.

As the user looks at the homescreen, they will be able to navigate through the webpage either by scrolling or by using the navbar presented at the top of the page.

![This image shows the navbar and the different options that the user can choose from.  The user can press 'home', 'About me', 'Portfolio', 'Contact', or 'Resume'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pazjenni04/JD-portfolio/main/images/navbar-img.PNG)

As the user scrolls down, they will first be presented with my 'About me' section. Under this section is a brief introduction of myself and my experience within web developing. Also, to personalize this section a bit, I added just a brief intro to my hobbies and interests. The images on this section captures my personality and my current passions in life in order to differentiate myself to others and seem more impressionable.

Added onto this section, I have included some skillsets that I feel confident in and necessary to showcase to the user.  If the user refreshes, the skills will reload and the bar graph will animate to the length set.

As the user continues to scroll down the page, they will be presented with my current portfolio.  In this section, I have posted 3 current projects that showcase my skills in  html,JavaScript, CSS, and Pure CSS and APIs.  When the user hovers over the projects, they will be presented with additional info including the title of the webpage, a brief description, github repo, and they can click 'read more' to get redirected to the actual deployed webpage.  This portion creates an interactive experience for the user.

Finally, as the user continues to scroll down the webpage they will come across my contact info section.  Within this section, I have insert icons that the user can click on and will redirect them either to directly email me, my Github profile, and/or my LinkedIn profile.

Throughout each section of the webpage, small, white arrows were implemented to assist the user to return back to the home viewport whenever they choose to.

NOTE: This webpage was created to be responsive to the users viewport, so media queries were implemented to make sure that elements react to the screen size.
